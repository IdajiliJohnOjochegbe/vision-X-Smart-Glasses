# Vision X Smart Glasses

## Project Overview

Vision X Smart Glasses is a project designed to assist visually impaired individuals in navigating their environment. The system utilizes YOLOv5 for real-time object detection and DistilBERT for providing contextual feedback on detected objects through voice output. The project integrates multiple technologies such as computer vision and natural language processing, offering feedback via text-to-speech for an enhanced user experience.

## Features

- **Real-Time Object Detection**: Leverages YOLOv5 to identify objects in the user's surroundings.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Uses Hugging Face’s DistilBERT for generating context-aware descriptions of the detected objects.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Integrates `pyttsx3` for converting the descriptions generated by DistilBERT into audible feedback.
- **CPU-Based Processing**: This prototype version runs on CPU, ensuring accessibility on standard computers without a dedicated GPU.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or later
- `pip` package manager

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IdajiliJohnOjochegbe/vision-X-Smart-Glasses
cd project-root
```

### Step 2: Set up Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv new_venv
.
ew_venv\Scriptsctivate  # On Windows
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install all the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure the following libraries are present in your environment:

- PyTorch
- transformers (Hugging Face)
- YOLOv5
- OpenCV
- pyttsx3

### Step 4: Download DistilBERT Model

Navigate to the `distilbert_model` folder and run the script to download and load the BERT model:

```bash
cd distilbert_model
python download_distilbert.py
```

### Step 5: Run the Main Script

Return to the project root directory and execute the main script to start real-time object detection and voice feedback:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Important Notes

- Ensure your webcam is connected and accessible for the object detection to work.
- YOLOv5 is loaded using the Torch Hub, and DistilBERT is loaded via Hugging Face’s `transformers` library.

## Troubleshooting

- **OpenCV Errors**: Ensure that OpenCV is properly installed and accessible. Try reinstalling with:
  ```bash
  pip install opencv-python
  ```

- **YOLOv5 Issues**: If YOLOv5 is not found, make sure that the `yolov5` folder is correctly referenced in the Python script or `sys.path`.
